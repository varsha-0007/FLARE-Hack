# 🚀 Flare Karma Engine — Reputation-Based Web3 Application  
A cross-chain reputation scoring application built on the **Flare Network**, enabling users to earn a *Trust Score* based on their on-chain activities. The app exists in **two versions (V1 & V2)**, designed for learning, experimentation, and deployment on RiseIn + Flare Testnet.

## 🧩 **Project Overview**
The **Flare Karma Engine** calculates a user’s **Trust Score (Karma Score)** using smart contract events, wallet interactions, and app activity.  
It helps dApps reward real user behavior such as:

- Regular usage  
- Transaction consistency  
- Good standing (no malicious activity)  
- Completing tasks and missions  
- Holding badges / achievements  

This system can be integrated into gaming, identity, loyalty programs, or decentralized reputation systems.
